To adjust the menu symbol:


1. Open sym-mega-menu-template.html in a text editor.

2. Correct the menu item names in the &lt;body&gt; section of the file. Update the URLs for the href="" attributes (ex: href="https://www.osisoft.com/").

3. Open sym-mega-menu-template.html in a web browser to preview the menu.



To install the custom symbol:


1. In Windows Explorer, navigate to the "PIPC\PIVision" installation folder on your PI Vision server; typically, it's located in "C:\Program Files\PIPC\PIVision"

2. From within the folder named "PIVision", navigate to the "\Scripts\app\editor\symbols\ext" sub-folder.  If there is no folder called "ext", create it.  

3. Paste into the "ext" folder sym-mega-menu.js and sym-mega-menu-template.html files.


The next time you open a web browser and navigate to PI Vision and create a new PI Vision display, you will see this new symbol appear in the top-left-hand corner of the PI Vision display editor.
